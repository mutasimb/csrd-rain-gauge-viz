This pet project is intended to do a favor to my boss and and colleagues at [CIMMYT](http://www.cimmyt.org/) to help them visualize the observed data collected by various rain gauge stations set up throughout Bangladesh as a part of the [Climate Services for Resilient Development Project](http://www.cs4rd.org/).
